				<p>The Highway 60 Corridor that cuts through the southern section of Algonquin Provincial Park boasts 14 
					different interpretive day use hiking trails. Each trail showcases unique landscapes, ecology, wildlife, 
					and history. These unique features are illustrated in companion trail guides which are read in conjunction 
					with interpretive trail markers on each trail. Each of these trails along the corridor are outlined here, 
					with trail name, location along the highway corridor starting from the Parkâ€™s West Gate and moving towards 
					the East Gate, length of trail, estimated duration to hike and challenge level.</p>
